# CADmium Co

If you havenâ€™t read the [blog post, start there.](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/cadmium)

## Context

First and foremost: We are here to build a kickass CAD app. It will be open source, local first, and browser based. It will be simple, powerful, and beautiful.

Our longer-term goal is to build a thriving ecosystem of happy, productive users. We will eventually support CAM, FEA, and other CAD-adjacent tasks, but not until the CAD aspects are working well.

Our ambition is to change much of manufacturing by offering a better product. We will break out of the walled gardens that we have spent our careers trapped in.

In the past few days we have gathered 700+ extremely smart, talented, motivated people in a Discord channel. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a serious impact on the world and we cannot waste it.

## Immediate Goals

1. Publish and maintain a beautiful, powerful, parametric CAD app that is open source, local first, and browser based
1. Build a community of users and a community of developers around this app so that it lives and breathes on its own. Enable an ecosystem of tools.

## Guiding Principles

**Pragmatism:** Aggressively cut scope in the name of delivering a product that works. Be the Google Docs to their Microsoft Word. Be the Obsidian to their Google Docs.

**Obviousness:** Anyone who has used parametric CAD should be able to walk up to CADmium and immediately start making parts without needing to watch tutorials. It must be streamlined, obvious, simple.

**Modernness:** Do not try to achieve cross-compatibility with any other modeling kernel or idiosyncratic file format. Beyond our new JSON-based formats, STEP and mesh I/O is sufficient. Break from tradition when needed.

**Loyalty:** Never pull the rug out from under our users. Never even create a situation where future rug-pulling becomes possible. Make money by providing value to people who want to pay, not by holding their data hostage.

**Beauty:** Put care and attention into everything we publish. Do not fall into the trap of carelessly aggregating features or letting older things rot. Focus on flows, cohesion, and visual clarity.
