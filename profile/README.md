# CADmium Co

If you havenâ€™t read the [blog post, start there.](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/cadmium)

## Context

First and foremost: We are here to build a excellent CAD app. It will be open source, local first, and browser based. It will be simple, powerful, and beautiful.

Our longer-term goal is to build a thriving ecosystem of happy, productive users. We will eventually support CAM, FEA, and other CAD-adjacent tasks, but not until the CAD aspects are working well.

Our ambition is to change much of manufacturing by offering a better product. We have spent our careers trapped in walled gardens and we will break out!

In the past few days we have gathered 900+ extremely smart, talented, motivated people in a Discord channel. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a serious impact on the world and we cannot waste it.

## Immediate Goals

1. Publish and maintain an elegant, powerful, parametric CAD app that is open source, local first, and browser based
1. Build a community of users and a community of developers around this app so that it lives and breathes on its own, enabling an ecosystem of tools

## Guiding Principles

**Pragmatism:** Aggressively cut scope in the name of delivering a product that works. Be the Google Docs to their Microsoft Word. Be the Obsidian to their Google Docs.

**Obviousness:** Anyone who has used parametric CAD should be able to walk up to CADmium and immediately start making parts without needing to watch tutorials. It must be streamlined, obvious, simple.

**Modernness:** Break from tradition when needed. Do not try to achieve cross-compatibility with any legacy modeling kernel. Build from scratch when required.

**Loyalty To The User:** Never pull the rug out from under our users. Never create a situation where future rug-pulling becomes possible. Make money by providing value to people who want to pay, not by holding their data hostage.

**Beauty:** Put care and attention into everything we publish. Focus on cohesion and visual clarity. Design matters.
